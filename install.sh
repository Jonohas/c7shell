#
# Afterwards it runs c7shell-doctor, which checks the things pacman cannot:
# the Hyprland version (the config is lua, 0.56+), the QML modules quickshell
# was built with, the GPU device, the appmenu daemon's python modules and
# whether the configs have reached ~/.config yet.

# One representative command per base-devel package makepkg insists on.
# debugedit only ships in its own package, which is why a machine that has
# an older base-devel installed can still be missing it.

usage: ./install.sh [options] [makepkg options...]

Takes a bare Arch install to a working c7shell session:
  1. installs the base-devel tools makepkg needs (fakeroot, debugedit, ...)
  2. runs c7shell-bootstrap: GPU driver, SDDM, pipewire, fonts, services
  3. runs makepkg -si to build and install the package
  4. runs c7shell-doctor to check the result and offer the optional programs

options (everything else is passed straight to makepkg):
  -n, --dry-run       show the bootstrap plan and stop, changing nothing
  -y, --yes           don't ask before applying the bootstrap plan
      --no-bootstrap  skip step 2 entirely (already-configured machine)
  -h, --help          this text

env: C7SHELL_SKIP_DEPS=1    don't touch base-devel, just run makepkg
     C7SHELL_SKIP_DOCTOR=1  don't run the post-install c7shell-doctor check
     C7SHELL_SKIP_OPTIONAL=1  don't offer the optional packages
     C7SHELL_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1 same as --no-bootstrap
     C7SHELL_BRANCH=<name>  build that branch instead of main (makepkg clones
                            the branch, not the working tree you run this in)

Next: copy the configs into your home directory (as your own user, not root):

    c7shell-setup

Then log out and pick the "c7shell" session, or run start-hyprland from a TTY.
Re-run c7shell-doctor at any time to re-check the requirements.
