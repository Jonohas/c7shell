# xdph's Screencopy custom_picker_binary path does `data.output.pop_back()` on
# the "screen:<name>" selection, expecting the reference hyprland-share-picker's
# trailing std::endl. c7shell's PickerApp.qml writes the selection itself, so it
# MUST emit that newline -- without it xdph strips a real character ("DP-3" ->
# "DP-"), finds no such output, and the screencast never starts (Discord shows
# a crash). Windows survive it (handle parse tolerates a short string); screens
# do not. This is invisible without a compositor and a portal on the bus, so
# the newline is asserted here where a future edit that drops it fails loudly.
