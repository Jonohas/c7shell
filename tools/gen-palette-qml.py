"""Compile quickshell/c7shell/palette.json into a QML singleton.

The shell itself does not need this: Quickshell has FileView, so
Services/PaletteStore.qml reads the JSON directly and a change takes effect on the
next start. Two consumers cannot.

  - The sddm greeter is plain QtQuick. It has no FileView, and QML's
    XMLHttpRequest refuses to read a local file unless QML_XHR_ALLOW_FILE_READ
    is set in the environment -- which, for a process sddm launches as the sddm
    user before any session exists, is not ours to set. Its PaletteStore.qml is
    therefore generated and committed, and tests/test-greeter.sh fails if it has
    gone stale. A login screen is the last place to put a file read that can
    fail.
  - The qml6 component tests, whose Theme stand-in has the same problem and no
    reason to solve it differently. tests/fixtures/theme-stub.sh generates one
    into the temporary import path on every run, so it is never stale.

JSON is valid JavaScript, so the values go in verbatim as an object literal;
the `_`-prefixed keys palette.json documents itself with are dropped.
